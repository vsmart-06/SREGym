"""Problem: a CronJob whose pod has a regular (non-native) sidecar container
prevents Job completion. Accumulated active Jobs are never reaped.

Real-world failure class
------------------------
A Kubernetes Job is only marked ``Complete`` when *every* container in the pod
terminates. When a CronJob's pod includes a sidecar designed for long-running
service work (a service-mesh proxy such as ``istio-proxy`` / ``linkerd-proxy``,
or a telemetry sidecar such as ``fluent-bit`` / ``fluentd`` / ``otel-collector``
/ ``datadog-agent``), the sidecar never receives a termination signal when the
primary container exits. The pod stays ``Running`` indefinitely and the Job
stays ``active``. Because ``successfulJobsHistoryLimit`` only applies to
*finished* Jobs, accumulated active Jobs are not reaped. Over hours the
namespace fills with hundreds of stuck Jobs and Pods.

This problem is officially documented by the Kubernetes project and was
significant enough to motivate the introduction of native sidecar containers in
Kubernetes 1.28 (KEP-753, ``initContainers`` with ``restartPolicy: Always``).
On clusters where workloads have not opted in to the native pattern — which is
still the majority of production manifests, Helm charts, and operator-managed
deployments — the legacy pattern continues to reproduce the same bug exactly as
reported in kubernetes/kubernetes#64056.

Simulation in SREGym
--------------------
A CronJob named ``audit-log-archiver`` is deployed into the Hotel Reservation
namespace. Its pod template contains:

* A primary container (``archiver``) that simulates a short, well-behaved audit
  log archival step — it logs, sleeps 1 second, and exits 0.
* A sidecar container (``fluent-bit-sidecar``) that simulates a fluent-bit log
  shipper running as a regular (non-native) sidecar — it logs and sleeps in an
  infinite loop, exactly as a real fluent-bit process would when configured to
  forward logs to a remote endpoint.

The CronJob's ``schedule`` is ``* * * * *`` (every minute). Each scheduled Job
runs the primary, which exits, but the sidecar keeps the pod alive forever.
After three to four schedule cycles the symptom is unambiguous: several Jobs
stuck at ``COMPLETIONS: 0/1`` whose pods show ``archiver`` ``Terminated/Completed``
and ``fluent-bit-sidecar`` ``Running``.

Accepted mitigation (enforced by the oracle)
--------------------------------------------
Convert the sidecar to the Kubernetes 1.28+ native sidecar pattern: move
it from ``spec.containers`` into ``spec.initContainers`` and set
``restartPolicy: Always`` on it. This is the architecturally correct fix
per KEP-753 -- K8s itself auto-terminates the sidecar after the primary
container exits, so the Pod reaches ``Succeeded`` and the Job reaches
``Complete``.

Rejected mitigations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Adding ``activeDeadlineSeconds`` to the jobTemplate. Time-bombs the
  workload rather than fixing the lifecycle bug. Real archival runs that
  exceed the deadline are killed mid-flight.
* Removing the sidecar container. Silently breaks audit-log forwarding
  to the SIEM.
* Deleting the CronJob. Removes the workload, not the bug.

Whichever fix the agent applies, it must also clean up the already-
accumulated active Jobs. The oracle rejects any active Job that still uses the
old regular-sidecar template, while allowing brief schedule-boundary activity
from the repaired template.
